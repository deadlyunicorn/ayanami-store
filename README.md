## E-store built with Next.JS 13
---
### About
I built this for fun, in order to practise my Next.JS - React.JS. I might use this project as template for future projects - or if I turn into a freelancer heheh. 

**Project so far**

 + Can show available products
 + Can add items to cart
 + Dark mode <3
 + Responsive design
 + 'Categories' and 'Explore' pages
 + Loaders (needs some CSS update tho)

**To do list**

- [ ] Create a navigation bar
- [ ] Footer with needed fields (about, terms etc.. general footer of an eshop)
- [ ] Custom checkout page 
- [ ] /admin page. Admins can update the products from there. (Especially useful in this case, as I couldn't find any 'team' functionality in Commerce.js)
- [ ] User Login -> View the same cart on multiple devices, store your creds for the next order, etc. *MIGHT NOT DO THIS*
- [ ] Maybe Google Analytics, most likely not here.
### Technologies used
+ Next.JS 13 - App Router
+ Deployed with Vercel (check the link to webpage on GitHub)
+ TailwindCSS
+ Commerce.js

	(I was looking for something free. That one had 2% commission on orders. I didn't plan to actually sell things, so we are good. I didn't use the driver. I did it using their API with Next.JS 13 fetch().

	Alternatives I could use  
	
	+ Saleor (Though there was a bit of set up needed, if I wanted to use it in the future without paying a fee. I've noticed some high latency with Commerce.js, maybe it would be better with Saleor Cloud during development..)  
	+ Some cloud database and design the schemas myself - handle auth etc... (Some options: Supabase (non commercial use), MongoDB, Firebase..)
	
	

### Vent
Ahh, that was perhaps the last project I will ever start with React. I am planning to start using Svelte. I also feel like Flutter > ReactNative, so React will kinda feel like nostalgy. I am planning on finishing all of the other unfinished projects by Summer's 2023 end.
